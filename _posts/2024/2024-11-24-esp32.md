[Getting Started with the ESP32 Development Board](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/):

Main Features:
* **Low-cost**: you can get an ESP32 starting at $6, which makes it easily accessible to the general public;
* **Low-power**: the ESP32 consumes very little power compared with other microcontrollers, and it supports low-power mode states like deep sleep to save power;
* [Wi-Fi capabilities](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-useful-wi-fi-functions-arduino/), wifi connect or wifi host.
* **Bluetooth** : supports [Bluetooth classic](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-bluetooth-classic-arduino-ide/) and [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-bluetooth-low-energy-ble-arduino-ide/) (100x less power).
* GPIO : [ESP32 Pinout Reference](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-pinout-reference-gpios/)
* Processor: Tensilica Xtensa Dual-Core 32-bit LX6 microprocessor, running at 160 or 240 MHz. The ESP32 is the ESP8266 successor.
* ESP32 Development Boards come with all the needed circuitry to power and program the chip.
* [Compatible with the Arduino “programming language”](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-esp32-arduino-ide-2-0/).
  * [Installing ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE 2](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-esp32-arduino-ide-2-0/)
* [Compatible with MicroPython](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-micropython-esp32-esp8266/).


### **Comparison: ESP32 vs ESP32-S3 vs ESP8266**  
<p></p>

| Feature          | **ESP8266** | **ESP32** | **ESP32-S3** |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Processor** | 80 MHz, single-core (Tensilica L106) | 240 MHz, dual-core (Xtensa LX6) | 240 MHz, dual-core (Xtensa LX7) |
| **RAM** | ~80 KB | 520 KB SRAM | 512 KB SRAM + 8 MB PSRAM (optional) |
| **Flash** | Up to 16 MB (external) | Up to 16 MB (external) | Up to 16 MB (external) |
| **Wi-Fi** | 2.4 GHz, 802.11 b/g/n | 2.4 GHz, 802.11 b/g/n | 2.4 GHz, 802.11 b/g/n |
| **Bluetooth** | ❌ | BT 4.2 + BLE | BT 5 + BLE |
| **USB Support** | ❌ | ❌ | USB OTG (Native) |
| **GPIO Pins** | ~11 usable | 34 (some have special functions) | 45 (some have special functions) |
| **ADC Channels** | 1x 10-bit | 18x 12-bit | 20x 12-bit |
| **SPI/I2C/I2S/UART** | 2x SPI, 1x I2C, 2x UART | 4x SPI, 2x I2C, 2x I2S, 3x UART | 4x SPI, 2x I2C, 2x I2S, 3x UART |
| **PWM** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Deep Sleep Power** | ~20 µA | ~10 µA | ~10 µA |
| **PSRAM (Extra RAM)** | ❌ | Optional (up to 8MB) | Optional (8MB default on some models) |
| **AI/ML Acceleration** | ❌ | ❌ | Yes (Vector instructions) |
| **Security Features** | Basic | Secure Boot, Flash Encryption | Secure Boot, Flash Encryption, AES-256 |
| **Price (approx.)** | $2-$4 | $5-$8 | $6-$10 |

✅ **ESP8266** – Best for simple IoT applications where low cost and Wi-Fi are enough (e.g., smart switches, basic sensors).  
✅ **ESP32** – Good for general-purpose IoT, dual-core performance, Bluetooth support, and power-efficient applications.  
✅ **ESP32-S3** – Ideal for advanced applications requiring AI acceleration, more GPIOs, USB support, and improved power efficiency.  

## ESP32 communication

[Comparative Performance Study of ESP-NOW, WiFi, Bluetooth](https://doc-pak.undip.ac.id/id/eprint/24998/1/Article_Comparative_Study.pdf) (classic BT is used in the paper, which similar to WIFI, is designed to transmit data continuously)

## ESP32-CAM

[Compatible with the Arduino “programming language”](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-esp32-arduino-ide-2-0/).
1. [Installing ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE 2](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-esp32-arduino-ide-2-0/). (attention if you are in a virtual env, when you try to install dependent python libs), install [ESP32](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html).
  * [Arduino IDE 2.3.3 has a bug](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/very-long-compiling-time-and-lockup-downloading-with-esp32/1310525) that causes index downloads and installation/updates of boards platforms libraries to hang when Serial Monitor is open.
2. Use board **AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM**.
3. Try the example code project: [ESP32-CAM Take Photo and Display in Web Server](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-take-photo-display-web-server/).
