[Emmy Amalie Noether](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Noether_Emmy/) : **Symmetry <-> Conservation Law**

* But our university is not symmetry, so some of the conservation laws are not preserved.
* In small regions, local symmetries are kept. Where we get continuity equation (instead of classic conservation of energy). (~ energy flow in space-time pipes)
