[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) is a powerful and highly flexible graph-based interface for building and running Stable Diffusion pipelines (and more).
ComfyUI is a node-based user interface for AI image generation, primarily designed around Stable Diffusion.
Think of it as **a visual programming environment** for creating AI image **workflow**s.
