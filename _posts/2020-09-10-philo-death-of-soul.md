Classes on Death, from Philosophy 176, of Yale University.

### Phaedo, Plato

The main driving of the *Phaedo* : Do we have any reason to believe the soul could survive the death of the body?
The existance of the soul is taken for granted in the dialogue. And Plato is a dualist, so he built *Socrates* to be dualist, and believe that the immortality of the soul.

Body do the sensation stuff, soul do the thinking stuff. The soul can think of certain concepts, or ideas.
There is nothing in this world that's perfectly beautiful, yet we can think about perfect beauty itself (same for perfect justice, perfect circularity). The mind has some kind of handle on these perfect “Platonic ideas”, "Platonic forms" (*Platonic Forms*).
Plato's thought that he puts in Socrates' mouth : *what the philosopher tries to do is to free himself from the distractions that the body poses* , all these distractions get in the way of thinking about the Platonic forms, so the philosopher would want to separate his mind as much as possible from the body. And he believe, when the death come and the final separation occurs, his mind gets to go up to *Plato's heaven*.

For an example, think of mathematics. When we talk about math, we are talking about numbers that the mind trying to grasp, while numbers are not physical objects. They are **Platonic abstract entities** that don't exist in space and time. Yet for all that, the mind can think about them.

Based on these, Plato try to argue that the soul can be immortal. As the physical world is constantly changing, from form to form, while the mind can grasp the platonic ideas that are constant, stable and realible. If we distance the soul from the distractions of the body. we get focus on the platonic ideas and forms. If we train to separate, when we dead, our soul will go up to the platonic heaven. While if you are not trying to, your soul may reincarnate to another body. We are living in the dark, somehow mistake about our reality. 

While How do we knoe that the soul won't be destoried with the death of the body? It could be that we need the body to continue thinking, we may want our body to exist to allow us to think.

### Forms

* <u>Ideas(Forms) are eternal/nonphysical.</u>
* <u>Eternal/nonphysical can only be grasped by the eternal/nonphysical.</u> The impure cannot attain pure. *It takes one to know one.*
* <u>So that, which grasps the Ideas(Forms) must be eternal/nonphysical.</u> -> nonphysical: not the body; eternal : immortal.

Objection: (mainly for the second argument.) It doesn't need to france to know the franch people. The biologyists can study cat without being cat. While the eteral/nonphysical objects maybe speical cases, and we only need a special case to support the argument. And we not yet see good reason to believe argument 2.

### Recycling

The parts of a car existed before the car is assambled. The parts existed prior to the existence of the car itself. The parts continue to exist after the car cease to. *Things coming to being composed of previously existing parts. When those things cease to have the form they had the parts get used for other purposes, they get recycled.* 

Objection : some parts may continue to exist after the death of the body, but we cannot sure that soul is one of these recycling parts. Take my heart as an example, came to exist along side with my body.

### Recollection

The reminding of something by something else that resembles it but is not the thing it reminds you of. Looking at the photograph, even not very good, will remind us of the person.

We all know about Platonic Forms, which not exist in the physical world. While various things we could found in this world, make us thinking about the Platonic Forms themselves. Ordinary objects in the world participate to a greater or lesser degree in the Platonic Forms. **These things remind us of the Platonic forms.**

To allow the photograph remind me of the person, we must have already been acquainted with the person. For the round plate to remind of *perfect roundness*, we must have already met perfect roundness itself. But this cannot happen in this life, this world. So it got to happen before, the soul must be around before we are born.

Objection : our acquaintance with the Platonic Forms could come about in this life for the very first time.

Objection : even soul could exist before body, it doesn't mean that it will exist after the death of body. Sometimes, the car destories the engines get destoried right after. We need to show the soul won't decompose/decade after the death of the body.

### Simplicity

*What kind of things can break, What kind of things won't break.* Composite things can be destoryed, while the Platonic  Forms cannot be destoryed (You cannot destory number, perfect circle). Because they are simple, they are not composed of anything (they have no part to take apart). Things that change are parts, things with parts can be destroyed.

* <u>only composite things can be destoryed.</u>
* <u>only changing things are composite.</u>
* <u>invisible things don't change.</u>
* So, <u>invisible things can't be destoryed.</u> Objection (Simmias), for an example harmony (music), harmony is to the harp as the mind is to the body [^1] . Might be a different conterexample.
* But <u>soul is invisible.</u> Can the soul be detected (considering the definition 3 of invisible)?
* So <u>soul can't be destoryed.</u> ("or nearly so")

The harmony metaphor are often used by physicists, as they talk about the mind as a way of talking about what the body can do when it's working properly. It's dependence is just the same way as harmony is dependent upon the physical instrument.

**Invisible** (Socrates' arguments turn on) :

* can't be seen.
* can't be observed (5 senses).
* can't be detected.

[^1]: Socrates argued for the inappropriate of the metaphor of the music, while he should argue that "harmony isn't invisible" or "harmony can't be destoryed". And harmony can be sensed, and not invisible, according to the border definition 2 of invisible.
