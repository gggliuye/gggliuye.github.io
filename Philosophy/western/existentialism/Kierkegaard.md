## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Life
Born in Copenhagen on May the 5th, 1813, during <u>the Danish Golden Age</u> a rich cultural period in Denmark. However Copenhagen was a poor city, the Danish state has gone bankrupt, only a few people who could preserve their property in these difficult times, include Kierkegaard's father.

From 1821 to 1830, Kierkegaard attended the School of Civic Virtue, where Kierkegaard studied and learned Latin, Greek, and history, among other subjects.
He went on to study theology at the University of Copenhagen.

The Concept of **Irony**
1. Socrates is *negative* in the sense that he refuses to present a positive thesis or doctrine, with concrete positive content. <u>Hegel's interpretation of Socrates.</u>
2. <u>The concept of Irony</u> : to undermine bourgeois society.
3. <u>Irony as a Controlled Element, the Truth of Irony</u>, his own view of the proper and appropriate use of irony.

### 1.2. Socratic
<p></p>

* Socratic **irony and ignorance**: Socrates pretending to be ignorant to encourage others, like Euthyphro, to explain their supposed expertise, often leading to Aporia (悖论) and their embarrassment. which also make the reader or listener self-active.
  * Kierkegaard admired Socrates' approach, seeing it as a way to <u>challenge complacency and provoke critical thinking in society</u>.
* Socrates argued that he was not a **Sophist** by emphasizing his commitment to the pursuit of truth, the distinction between knowledge and opinion, the importance of moral integrity, and his unique method of inquiry.
* Socrates considered himself a **gadfly** because he aimed to provoke thought, challenge societal norms, and inspire self-examination among the citizens of Athens.
* Socrates' **daimon** serves as a negative force, preventing Socrates from making poor decisions, but does not provide positive guidance.
* Socrates practiced **maieutics**, likening his questioning technique to midwifery, helping others to discover truths within themselves (emphasizing that he <u>is not teaching anything</u>).
  * It is the individual's responsibility to seek answers. (since "we are born with ideas")

Søren Kierkegaard saw himself as <u>a modern-day Socrates</u>. Kierkegaard likened his own philosophical task to that of Socrates, aiming to <u>stimulate reflection among his contemporaries, particularly regarding their understanding of Christianity</u>.
(1) Provocation of Thought
(2) Focus on the Individual
(3) Critique of Established Norms
(4) Method of Indirect Communication
(5) Moral and Ethical Inquiry

## 2. Kierkegaard, Martensen and Hegelianism

**Autonomy** is often equated with freedom, allowing individuals to make their own choices.
Autonomy also seen negative, for undermining tradition, community, and religious values.  

**Martensen** "On the Autonomy of Human Self-Consciousness" (1837) critiques the philosophies of Kant, Schleiermacher, and Hegel, focusing on the concept of autonomy.
* Martensen argues that these thinkers emphasize individual autonomy too heavily, neglecting the essential dependency of humans on God.
* He introduces the idea of <u>"modern autonomy,"</u> suggesting that while individual self-consciousness is important, it should not overshadow the recognition of divine influence and communal values, arguing for a balance with dependence on God and tradition.

**Hegel**'s investment on Socrates in *The History of Philosophy*, (and Kierkegaard's investment on Socratic Irony) using three main sources *The Philosopher Plato*, *The historian Xenophon*, *The comic writer Aristophanes*.
* Hegel portrays Socrates as a **pivotal moment** in the shift from the objective focus (understanding the natural world) of Pre-Socratic philosophers to <u>an inward examination of thought and self-awareness</u>.
* Traditional view of **nature law** - somethings are right or wrong by nature.
  * Hegel argues that Socrates introduced the idea that individuals must <u>attain truth through their own rational examination</u> (**subject truth**), challenging the acceptance of traditional customs and beliefs (**object truth**).
  * Kierkegaard 1846 develops this distinction : **Objective truth** of Christianity (determined by historical record, sources, and so far), **Subjective truth** - the individual's relation to Christianity.
* Hegel highlights Socrates' role in questioning **established norms**, suggesting that this critical approach laid the groundwork for modern conceptions of subjectivity and individual autonomy.


### 主观真理的探究

如果主观真理依赖于个体的感受与信仰，那它凭什么是“真理”，而不仅仅是“**个人观点**”？

#### 苏格拉底的观点

苏格拉底强调<u>“真理存在于人的内心反思中”</u>（“内心”是理性灵魂（psyche）的自我反思能力），而非外在权威：
* 他认为通过理性对话，人可以觉察自己的无知；
* 真理不是被“灌输”的，而是“被引生”的（产婆术）。由此，真理的证明不是外在验证，而是：<u>当一个命题经过理性自省、逻辑审查、对话辩证后，不再自相矛盾、不依附权威、能被理性共同认可，它就达到了“被证明的内在真理”。</u>
* 这种“内在生成”的真理，本质上是一种**主观的、存在性的觉悟**。<u>真理不在外在的权威、传统或神话中，而在于理性灵魂能否通过对话、反思、推理，发现自己内在的理性秩序。</u>苏格拉底式“真理证明”的三个标准：
  1. 逻辑一致性（Logical Consistency）
  2. 普遍可沟通性（Universality through Dialogue）
  3. 道德可实践性（Moral Practicability）

#### 克尔凯郭尔重定义真理

克尔凯郭尔有意要对**真理**的意义做一次革命性*重定义*。他把“真理”从认识论范畴（关于“是什么”）转移到<u>存在论范畴（关于“我如何存在”）</u>。

| 命题真理（客观真理）(关于世界的命题) | 存在真理（主观真理）(关于我自己的存在方式)    |
| :--------- | :------------ |
| “上帝存在”     | “我以信仰的方式生活”   |
| “人应当行善”    | “我在具体处境中选择行善” |
| “死亡不可避免”   | “我如何以勇气面对死亡”  |

即使我无法证明“上帝存在”，但若我以信仰的方式生活，我在“存在的意义上”是真实的。这种真理的“真”，不在逻辑上成立，而在于“我整个存在与之合一”——它是一种**存在的诚实**（authenticity）。

#### 克尔凯郭尔的主观真理

* 克尔凯郭尔并不否认“客观真理”，在科学、逻辑、事实层面，真理必须是客观可验证的；<u>但这些真理“对人的存在无意义”，因为它们不能告诉人“该如何生活”。</u>
* 主观真理的**“真”**，在于**存在的强度**而非命题的正确性：“主观真理”不是“任意观点”，而是**“存在的真诚性”（existential truth）**——<u>“我以全部生命的诚实去承担、实践、受苦于这种信念。”</u>

> 一个牧师在讲台上精确地解释上帝存在的逻辑，却并不信；一个平凡的农夫以全部生命信仰上帝，却无法证明祂存在。

牧师掌握了客观真理的命题，农夫活出了主观真理的存在, 所以农夫更接近真理。“重要的不是上帝是否存在（objective），而是我是否以信仰的方式存在（subjective）。”
