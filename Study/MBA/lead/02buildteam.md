# 1. Team Culture: Defined

**Definition of Culture**: According to Ed Schein, culture is <u>a pattern of assumptions developed by a group to cope with challenges, which is taught to new members.</u>
- **Elements of Culture**: Culture includes observable behaviors, espoused values, and underlying assumptions. It can significantly affect team performance.
- **Examples of Team Culture**: Different team dynamics are illustrated, such as informal interactions versus strict adherence to agendas, and how these reflect underlying cultural values.
- **Assessing Culture**: Leaders can evaluate their team's culture by observing behaviors, listening for values, and identifying assumptions that drive outcomes.
- **Intentional Culture Building**: Leaders should be proactive in shaping a culture that promotes safety, engagement, and growth, as this can lead to better team performance.


**Three Qualities of Effective Teams**:
1. **Performance**: Effective teams deliver valuable outputs, which should be evaluated by external metrics.
2. **Member Benefits**: Team members should gain satisfaction, knowledge, and skills from their experiences.
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Teams should learn and adapt over time, encouraging open communication and the sharing of diverse perspectives.

- **Communication and Coordination**: Effective teamwork requires clear communication and alignment among team members to ensure everyone is on the same page.
- **Cultural Aspects**: Creating a culture that values contributions from all members and encourages learning is essential for team success.


Leaders influence team culture and must empower team members to take initiative and make decisions.
**Creating a Safe Environment**: Leaders should foster a culture where team members feel safe to express problems and learn from failures.
**Humility in Leadership**: Great leaders often exhibit humility and lead by example, creating an environment where team members feel valued and engaged.
**Team Dynamics**: The success of a team often relies on the leader's ability to recognize and utilize the strengths of team members.

# 2. Cultures of Safety

## 2.1 Reading

üçé [Google‚Äôs Project Aristotle](https://psychsafety.com/googles-project-aristotle/) back in 2013, showed that : A strong sense of **psychological safety** (<u>Team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other<u>) fostered an environment where members felt comfortable expressing their thoughts and ideas openly, leading to more productive discussions and innovative solutions.
* The co-location of teams had no impact on their performance as long as they possessed **psychological safety**.
* Two more norms : (1) Equality in conversational turn-taking; (2) High ‚Äúsocial sensitivity‚Äù.

üçé [Psychological Safety in Remote and Virtual Teams 2024](https://psychsafety.com/psychological-safety-in-remote-teams/)
1. Talk about psychological safety.
2. Make sure everyone knows what to do (what is expected of them) and make work visible.
3. Focus on outcomes, not inputs or outputs (focussed on what really matters to the business or organisation).
4. Build a culture of appreciation.
5. Embrace routine and ritual.
6. Establish work boundaries.
7. Be actively inclusive, or risk being passively exclusive.
8. Establish multiple communication channels for different needs.
9. Cultivate curiosity before jumping to conclusions.
10. Clarify your intentions with considerate language, emojis, and gifs.

## 2.2 Fostering Psychological Safety

**Psychological Safety**: a shared belief that team members can speak up without fear of humiliation or punishment.
**Learning from Mistakes**: Encouraging a culture where mistakes are acknowledged and learned from is crucial.
It helps create a sense of belonging, which is necessary for genuine **inclusiveness**.

- **Cultural Development**: Psychological safety is a culture that takes time to develop. Leaders should model **transparency**, **honesty**, and **vulnerability**.
- **Encouraging Participation**: Leaders should invite team members to share their thoughts and concerns, creating an environment where silence is less likely.
- **Conversational Norms**: Successful teams focus on **how** they communicate rather than **who** is on the team. Every member should have the opportunity to speak during meetings.
- **Empathy and Social Sensitivity**: Leaders should be aware of team members' emotions and encourage open discussions about challenges.
- **Addressing Bad Behavior**: It's important for leaders to address negative behaviors that threaten psychological safety, ensuring a supportive team culture.

## 2.3 Cultivating Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging

- **Vulnerability**: Many people hesitate to speak up due to fear of sounding foolish, which can suppress valuable contributions.
- **Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB)**: These elements are crucial for fostering a psychologically safe environment. Diversity encompasses various differences among team members, equity ensures fair access to resources, inclusion creates a space for all voices, and belonging fosters a sense of acceptance.
- **Below the Surface Leadership**: This concept focuses on authentic connections and prioritizing the needs of others, which helps create a culture of safety and support.
- **Empathy and Understanding**: Leaders should strive to understand different perspectives and experiences, recognizing that individual experiences shape how people perceive situations.

## 2.4 Developing Ethical Cultures

The lecture discusses **Luckin Coffee**, a Chinese coffee company that rapidly grew from its founding in 2017 to a valuation of over $12 billion by 2020. However, it faced serious allegations of fraud, leading to its suspension from NASDAQ and bankruptcy. The lecture emphasizes that ethical failures in organizations often stem from a culture that allows unethical behavior rather than individual decisions.

- **Ethical Culture**: Defined as the interplay of formal and informal systems that promote ethical or unethical behavior.
- **Corporate Ethical Virtues Model**: Identifies eight elements that facilitate ethical culture: clarity, congruency of supervisors and management, feasibility, supportability, transparency, discussability, and sanctionability.
- **Benefits of Ethical Culture**: Research shows that a strong ethical culture leads to increased employee satisfaction, reduced burnout, and improved overall performance.

## 2.5 Navigating Hierarchy

The lecture discusses the relationship between **team hierarchy** and the success of mountain climbing expeditions, based on a 2015 research study. Key points include:

- **Power Distance**: This concept measures how power is distributed within teams. High power distance teams have clear authority, while low power distance teams distribute power more equally.
- **Findings**: High power distance teams were more likely to reach the summit but also had higher risks of fatalities. This suggests that while clear hierarchy can improve decision-making and coordination, it may also stifle communication and safety.
- **Social Hierarchies**: Hierarchies naturally emerge in groups, even without formal structures. They can be based on status (respect and admiration) and power (control over resources).
- **Implications for Safety**: Understanding the dynamics of power and status is crucial for fostering a culture of safety within teams. <u>While hierarchies can enhance teamwork, they can also create distance that hinders communication.<u>

It emphasizes the need to recognize the types of hierarchies present and to establish structures that promote inclusion, ethical cultures, and effective decision-making.
