</aside>

Marketing has moved from being **product-centric (Marketing 1.0)** to being **consumer-centric (Marketing 2.0)**.
Marketing 3.0 is the stage when companies shift from consumer-centricity to **human-centricity** and where profitability is balanced with corporate responsibility.

We see a company not as a sole and self-sustaining operator in a competitive world but as a company that operates
with <u>a loyal network of partners—employees, distributors, dealers, and suppliers.</u>
The company must <u>share its mission, vision, and values</u> with its team members so that they act in unison to achieve their goals.

* In Part I, we summarize the key business trends that shape the human-centric marketing imperative and lay the foundation for Marketing 3.0.
* In Part II, we show how the company can market its corporate vision, mission, and values to each of its key stakeholders—consumers, employees, channel partners, and shareholders.
* In Part III, we share their thoughts on several key implementations of Marketing 3.0 for solving global issues such as wellness, poverty, and environmental sustainability and how corporations can contribute by implementing the human-centric business model.

# Part I : Trends
## Chapter 1. Welcome to Marketing 3.0

**Marketing 1.0**: the core technology was industrial machinery, products were fairly basic and were designed to **serve a mass market**.
<u>对消费者来说，看似自由、实际上受限的选择</u>: “Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.”（福特为了实现流水线大规模生产、降低成本、提高效率，决定只生产黑色的 T 型车。）

**Marketing 2.0**: came out in information age. **CUSTOMER IS KING** : The product value is defined by the consumer. Consumers differ greatly in their preferences. The marketer must segment the market and develop a superior product for a specific target market.
Unfortunately, the consumer-centric approach implicitly assumes the view that consumers are <u>passive targets of marketing campaigns</u> ： 暗中假设消费者只是营销活动的被动接受者。

**Marketing 3.0** values-driven era. Instead of treating people simply as consumers, marketers approach them as <u>whole human beings with minds, hearts, and spirits.</u> Increasingly, consumers are looking for solutions to their anxieties about making the globalized world a better place.
They look for <u>human spirit fulfillment in the products and services they choose.</u>
Aims to **provide solutions to address problems in the society.**

> Marketing 3.0：为何突然跳到“价值观”与“社会责任”？
> Marketing 3.0 并不是资本主义突然转向社会利益，而是资本在逐利逻辑下的升级伪装——把社会关切转化为新的消费驱动力。这么看，市场是跟着社会整体的需求变化的。
> 1. 消费升级与品牌竞争白热化。单纯的“产品好”已经不足以形成竞争力。大家都能提供质量和功能，差异化开始转向价值观、文化认同。
> 2. 全球化与社会问题凸显。环保、贫富差距、气候变化等问题进入公众视野。消费者尤其是年轻一代，更倾向于支持“有责任感”的品牌。这导致企业被迫在营销中强调社会价值、使命感。
> 3. 资本的自我包装。从批判角度看，Marketing 3.0 其实并没有抛弃逐利，而是把“逐利”包裹在“社会责任”的叙事里。

### THE AGE OF PARTICIPATION AND COLLABORATIVE MARKETING

New wave technology consists of three major forces: cheap computers and mobile phones, low-cost Internet, and open source.
One of the enablers of new wave technology is the rise of social media
* Expressive Social Media : Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, etc. is <u>the future for marketing communications.</u>
* Collaborative Media : Wikipedia, Rotten Tomatoes, and Craigslist. reflects : <u>the collective power of consumers.</u>

Customers are no longer passive but are active in giving useful feedback to companies.

### THE AGE OF GLOBALIZATION PARADOX AND CULTURAL MARKETING

Unlike technology, globalization is a force that stimulates counterbalance. Globalization is indeed full of paradoxes.
* While democracy is finding more global roots, the new, nondemocratic superpower, Ghina, grows in power.
* Globalization calls for economic integration but does not create equal economies.
* Globalization creates not a uniform but a diverse culture.

Individuals have started to feel the pressure of becoming global citizens as well as local citizens. As a result, many people are anxious and carry conflicting intertwined values in their minds.

Author Charles Handy suggests that people should not try to solve these paradoxes but rather try to manage them. To do that, people reach for <u>a sense of continuity in their lives</u>. People search for <u>connection with others</u>. People begin to blend into their local community and society. Yet a sense of direction is also essential in times of paradox.

**Cultural Brands** : <u>Companies are now competing to be seen as providing continuity, connection, and direction.</u>
* Address social, economic, and environmental issues in the society.
* Need to be dynamic.
* Marketers must understand something about **anthropology and sociology**.

“Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for consumers, clients, partners, and **society** at large.”


### THE AGE OF CREATIVE SOCIETY AND HUMAN SPIRIT MARKETING

The rise of the creative society.
Marketing 3.0 强调企业与消费者的精神共鸣，将创造性社会的自我实现和价值观融入商业模式，通过满足消费者精神需求而实现长期价值与利润。
* 在创造性社会中，人们更关注自我实现和精神需求（Zohar提出倒置金字塔概念）。科学家和艺术家往往追求意义、幸福和精神实现，物质满足往往是附属奖励。
* 消费者不仅寻找满足需求的产品，还寻求能够触动精神层面的体验和商业模式。
* 营销的价值主张应提供**意义与精神价值**，而不仅是物质利益（values-driven business model）。
* 企业应将价值观融入企业文化、使命和愿景，而不是仅仅做公关或社会责任宣传。
* 真正的 Marketing 3.0 是**企业的自我实现与消费者精神需求对接**：利润源于企业对人类福祉的贡献得到消费者认可。


## Chapter 2. Future Model for Marketing 3.0

### The past 60 years

Three major disciplines of Marketing:
* **Product Management** 1950s and 1960s.
  * McCarthy’s four Ps : develop a product, determine the price, do the promotion, and set up the place of distribution.
  * Future : **Cocreation**.
* **Customer Management** 1970s and the 1980s.
  * STP (segmentation, targeting, positioning)
  * Economic growth had mostly migrated to developing countries in Asia. Demand was scarce.
  * More Ps : people, process, physical evidence, public opinion, and political power.
  * Future : **Communitization**.
* **Brand Management** 1990s and the 2000s.
  * Brand Building.
  * Future : **Character building**.


### THE FUTURE OF MARKETING: HORIZONTAL NOT VERTICAL
<p></p>

* After the economic crisis, customers are more cautious. If spending remains low, then economic growth will be slow, each reinforcing the other
* Low-trust environment. Currently, <u>trust exists more in horizontal relationships than in vertical relationships.</u>
  * Consumers believe one another more than they believe in companies or even experts.

To succeed, companies should understand that consumers increasingly appreciate **cocreation, communitization, and characters**:

* **Cocreation**: the new ways of creating product and experience through collaboration by companies, consumers, suppliers, and channel partners interconnected in a network of innovation.
  1. Company creates “platform”.
  2. Let individual consumers customize the platform.
  3. Enrich the platform, by incorporating all the customization efforts made by the network of consumers.
* **Communitization**, help consumers connect to one another in communities of pools, webs, or hubs.
  * They share belief and strong affiliation to a brand.
* **Character Building** reflect the brand’s identity in consumers’ social networks.
  * Companies should always try to be real and deliver experiences that live up to what they claim. losing credibility means losing the whole network of potential buyers.

### SHIFT TO HUMAN SPIRIT: THE 3i MODEL
<p></p>

brand-positioning-differentiation:

* **Brand identity**:
  * Targeting the mind : The idea of the product must be positioned meaningfully and uniquely in the mind of the target customers. (Volvo - Safe)
  * Supports its positioning with a solid differentiation.: Being credible, fulfilling your promise, and establishing consumers’ <u>trust</u> in your brand.
* **Brand image**:
  * Targeting the hearts : emotional marketing. (Apple, Starbucks)
* **Brand integrity**:
  * Targeting the spirit : understand the anxieties and desires of the consumers.


### SHIFT TO VALUES-DRIVEN MARKETING

Values-Based Matrix (VBM) Model

|  | Mind | Heart | Spirit |
| MISSION (why) | Deliver SATISFACTION | Realize ASPIRATION | Practive COMPASSION|
| VISION (What) | ProfitAbility | ReturnAbility | SustainAbility |
| VALUES (How) | Be BETTER | DIFFERENTIATE | Make a DIFFERENCE |

<p></p>

* **Mission**:
  * Drucker argued that successful businesses do not start their planning with financial returns. They start with the performance of their mission. Financial returns will come as results.
  * Doughnut : mission is the core that cannot be changed.
* **Vision** : the desirable future state of the company.
* **Values** : articulate a set of corporate priorities and management attempts to embed them in its practices.


### MARKETING 3.0: THE MEANING OF MARKETING AND THE MARKETING OF MEANING

Marketing is about clearly defining your unique identity and strengthening it with authentic integrity to build a strong image.


# Part II : STRATEGY

## Chapter 3. Marketing the Mission to the Consumers

In Marketing 3.0, you don’t really own your brands once they are successful. CONSUMERS ARE THE NEW BRAND OWNERS!


**business as unusual, a story that moves people, and customer empowerment.**
一个好的品牌使命，在 Marketing 3.0 看来，是一个“非凡的承诺 + 引人共鸣的故事 + 实现参与”的组合。这不仅关乎品牌要“做什么”，还关乎品牌“为什么做”以及“和谁一起做”。

1. **Creating : Business as Unusual.** which transform the lives of consumers.
  * 好的使命承诺带来某种改变，不只是产品功能上的改进，而是改变消费者的生活态度、行为或世界的某部分。
2. **Spreading : Story that Moves People.** Three elements : character, plot, and metaphor.
  * 使命要有故事性，通过形象、生动的叙述让人理解、感受、接受，甚至传播。这样才不会被当成空话。
3. **Realizing : Consumer Empowerment.** the platform for consumer conversation.
  * 使命不能只是由公司顶层制定然后灌输，而是要让消费者感觉他们是这个使命的一部分。让他们参与进来，如共同创造、反馈、共鸣等。这样使命才有真实的力量，也更能持续。

## Chapter 4. Marketing the Values to the Employees

### Values

In Marketing 3.0, companies must convince both their customers and their employees to take their values seriously.
当代很多公司使命和价值观已经虚化，变得像是公关 / 营销用语。企业与高管的形象受损，公众和员工的信任度下降。

* **Permission-to-play values** : are standards of conduct. 比如行为规范、基本诚信、专业性等.
* **Aspirational values** : that a company lacks but the management hopes to achieve.
* **Accidental values** : acquired as a result of common personality traits of employees.公司因为员工个性、历史文化等自然形成，但并未刻意设定、也可能与公司使命不匹配、或者不具代表性的价值。
* **Core values** : the real corporate culture that guides employees’ actions. 真正的核心价值，需要是公司使命导向、可以被员工认同、并体现在日常行为中的。企业文化的共享部分。

**Shared values + Common behavior** 是企业文化的两大半边：
Shared values 是大家共同认同的价值观
Common behavior 是这些价值观如何在日常工作中被实践（通过决策、交互、服务、态度等）

Having great core values delivers several payoffs:
* Attracting and Retaining Talent. 如果一个公司有真实、被人信任的共享价值观，更容易吸引有志者留下来。
* Back-Office Productivity and Front-Office Quality
* Integrating and Empowering Differences. 在全球化、多地区运营的公司里，有很多文化、地域、背景不同的员工。共享价值观可以成为整合这些差异的纽带。还可以让分散/在地的员工有更多自主性和授权去进行决策，因为信任与价值观已经建立。

<p></p>

### Practice What You Preach
<p></p>

* 正式培训和非正式教练（informal coaching）都很重要，但培训本身可能不足以让员工真正“活出”价值观。
* **Aligning values with behavior**: 公司需要设计机制，让真实行动（actions）与价值观挂钩：比如绩效考评、奖金激励、项目选择等，与价值观一致的行为得到奖励，偏离的行为被纠正。
  * Should examine current corporate policies that might weaken corporate values.
  * Should create a mechanism that directly links actions with values.
* 值得注意的实践案例：
  * BagelWorks：为了“健康与安全”的价值观，公司宁可买更小包装的面粉包，以减少员工搬重物导致的伤害，尽管这样成本更高。
  * Wegmans：员工被训练了解食物、热爱食物，把“食物的文化”带入工作中；员工能够“活出食物文化”的价值观。
  * S.C. Johnson：公司倡导家庭价值观，不只是工作中，而是让员工在家庭与工作平衡方面受益，比如周末与家庭时间等。

<p></p>
### Shared Values and Common Behavior
<p></p>

* 真正的企业文化是 aligning the shared values and common behavior of employees (共享的价值观 + 员工的共同行为 结合体)。价值观如果只停留在口号或海报上，而不落实到行为中，就无法建立信任和认同。
* 在Marketing 3.0中，员工不仅是被动接受者，更是品牌使命和价值观的“传播者”（ambassadors）。员工的行为、态度会被消费者观察并影响品牌可信度。
* 共享价值与行为要与外部的趋势（协作、文化变迁、创造力）结合，这样价值观不仅内部一致，也对外部有吸引力、可感知性。

## Chapter 5. Marketing the Values to the Channel Partners

**COLLABORATION IMPERATIVE** The developed market, too, is transforming into a completely different kind of market. The maturing market is just a small signal of the big changes that are taking place.
企业不能单靠直销模式或单一路径，就要学会与渠道伙伴合作共同传递品牌价值。


**CHANNEL PARTNERS**渠道伙伴不仅仅是“分销产品”的中介，也可能是使命／价值观的传播者 (cultural change agents)、品牌故事的合作者／共创者 (creative partners)。他们自身也有使命、身份与价值观。企业要识别这些，选对伙伴。
* Selecting the Fit : 伙伴的目标（Purpose）、身份（Identity）和价值观（Values）要与企业本身高度兼容。
* Channel Partners as Cultural Change Agent: Distributing the Story:. 渠道伙伴不仅要分销产品，还要帮助传播品牌故事、维持价值主张。
  * 在贫穷或欠发达地区，分销渠道不仅是商业手段，也关系到改善民众生活质量。


在 Marketing 3.0 中，品牌要向渠道伙伴传递价值观，不仅是为了销售产品，而是为了让品牌的使命与故事能够完整地到达消费者，维护品牌的诚信与一致性。渠道伙伴如果能与品牌共享使命／身份／价值观，并在日常分销与沟通中践行，那么公司与渠道伙伴可以获得更强的竞争优势与更深的社会影响力。

### Channel Partners In China

在中国市场，渠道伙伴（Channel Partners）大致分为几类：
* 汽车类经销商集团：广汇汽车、中升集团、庞大汽贸。
* 家电/数码类经销商：苏宁易购、国美电器。
* 饮料/快消品经销商：娃哈哈、蒙牛、青岛啤酒依托的大量地方分销商。
* 手机/电子产品经销商：迪信通（手机连锁），以及各类省级/市级总代。

## Chapter 6. Marketing the Vision to the Shareholders

股东传统上更关心 短期回报与利润，而 Marketing 3.0 的愿景更多诉求于长期回报、社会与环境责任、品牌声誉、可持续发展等。这些长期／非物质性的价值，如何被量化、被说服、成为股东决策中的一部分，是本章重点。

**Short-Termism Hurts the Economy**
Short-termism drives risky strategies that can cause the economy to collapse.


**Long-Term Shareholder Value = Vision of Sustainability**. Two trends:
* **Market Polarization** → 消费者需求差异大，中端市场压力大，高端和低端的策略不同。
  * 一端是**高端／高收入／价值导向**的消费者，他们追求品质、品牌、社会价值、可持续性。
  * 另一端是**低端／低收入／价格敏感型**消费者，他们关注基本功能、性价比和价格。
  * 中端市场往往被压缩或被夹在两极之间的竞争压力下，被高端和低端品牌同时挤压。
* **Scarce Resources** → 企业必须战略性分配有限资源，不可能全方位满足所有市场。稀缺资源不仅指自然资源（能源、水、土地等），也指：人力资源、资本、时间。


通过**可持续发展、使命感和长期战略**，让股东理解即便短期利润受限，长期资源利用和品牌价值会得到更大回报。
Sustainability and Shareholder Value， 可持续性不只是道德责任、社会责任，也可以成为创造股东价值的方式。
可持续实践能带来三类可财务量化的利益：成本生产率提升；开辟新市场带来的收入增长；以及品牌价值的提升。

Marketing Visionary Strategy ： 管理层需要向股东清楚地展示战略愿景――不仅讲使命与价值观，也要有具体指标与可执行方案。


Summary : 公司要让股东认识到，一个以可持续性、使命感与价值观为导向的愿景，不是“妨碍利润”的奢侈品，而是通向更大长期股东价值的路线图；管理层的任务是用具体指标与商业案例，将这种愿景变成股东可以理解、支持并为之投资的战略。
- 用三个关键财务相关指标说服股东：① 成本生产率（Cost Productivity）改善；② 新市场机遇带来的高收入增长；③ 企业品牌价值（Corporate Brand Value）增强。
- 强调长期回报（returnability）比短期盈利（profitability）更重要。股东可能要短期亏损或低利润，但如果公司在可持续性和品牌价值上建立了信誉与竞争优势，那么长期回报潜力更大。
- 管理层需要有效沟通这些，并将之纳入公司报告、投资者关系、治理结构中。


# Part III : Application

## Chapter 7. Delivering Socio-Cultural Transformation

Being a marketer in the 3.0 era is <u>collaborating with other companies to find creative ways to social solve problems.</u>

* Example : Need for Future Growth: Disney on Children’s Nutrition.
* Example : Call for Strong Differentiation: Wegmans on Healthy Living.


**Philanthropy** (direct donation) helps society, but has limited effects, with a rather short-term impact.
**Cause-Marketing** : A more advanced form is <u>support a specific cause through their marketing activities.</u>

| Identify Socio-Cultural Challenges | Select Target Constituents | Offer Transformational Solution |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| - Identify current and predict future challenges.<br> - Challenges may include wellness (nutrition and health care), education or social injustice | - For immediate impact : select constituents such as the middle class, women, or the eldery<br> -For future impact : select children and youth |  - Provide behavior-changing solutions moving up the Maslow Pyramid <br>- Aim toward more collaborative, cultural, and creative transformation.|

<p></p>

## Chapter 8. Creating Emerging Market Entrepreneurs

FROM PYRAMID TO DIAMOND, FROM AID TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP
The pyramid must be reshaped into a diamond.

* **THREE ENABLING FORCES**, reduce poverty (the bottom of the economic pyramid):
  1. Increased access among the poor to information and communication technology infrastructure.
  2. The blend of excess supply, under-consumption in mature markets, and hyper-competition at the top and middle of the pyramid.
  3. Government policy to discourage people from migrating to overcrowded urban areas.
* **FOUR REQUIREMENTS**:
  1. Its scale should be huge to reach the billions who are in poverty.
  2. Solutions must be enduring and last over generations.
  3. Solutions must be truly effective and make a difference.
  4. All this must happen efficiently.

Social business enterprise (SBE) : a company that is making money while impacting the society in which it operates.

## Chapter 9. Striving for Environmental Sustainability

Three roles : the Innovator, the Investor, or the Propagator.

* The Innovator: DuPont Case. Environment-saving products forms the core of their raison d’être.
* The Investor: Wal-Mart Case. Lending financial resources to support environmentally friendly projects
* The Propagator: Timberland Case. Seek to create environmental ambassadors by spreading the values of protecting the earth to employees and consumers.


Motivations of Different Actors

| Innovator | Propagator | Investor |
| Enabler | Promoter | Amplifier |
| - Natural resources dependence<br> - Current exposure to regulation <br>- Increasing potential for regulation | - Competitive market for talent <br>- Low market power in highlty competitive market<br>- Good environmental track records | - High brand exposure<br>- Big environmental impact |

Companies need to distinguish the four segments in the green
market—the trendsetters, value-seekers, standard matchers,
and cautious buyers and note their differing behaviors and
readiness to buy green products.


## Chapter 10. Putting It All Together

<p></p>
* CREDO 1: LOVE YOUR CUSTOMERS, RESPECT YOUR COMPETITORS
  * emotion leads to actions while reason leads to conclusions
* CREDO 2: BE SENSITIVE TO CHANGE, BE READY TO TRANSFORM
* CREDO 3: GUARD YOUR NAME, BE CLEAR ABOUT WHO YOU ARE
* CREDO 4: CUSTOMERS ARE DIVERSE; GO FIRST TO THOSE WHO CAN BENEFIT MOST FROM YOU

* CREDO 9: ALWAYS REFINE YOUR BUSINESS PROCESS IN TERMS OF QUALITY, COST, AND DELIVERY
* CREDO 10: GATHER RELEVANT INFORMATION, BUT USE WISDOM IN MAKING YOUR FINAL DECISION


Topic deserve further research:
* Market Polarization
