* Ads are IDEOLOGICAL.
* Ads borrow referent systems (science, history, geography, evaluation, etc) from outside advertising and rework them.
* According to Williamson, the ideological power of ads can be dealt with by understanding how ads work.
  * And we need to understand them to avoid ads from <u>confusing us about the reality</u>.

### 3.2. The intentions of ad creators and the interpretations of viewers

The distinction between the intentions of ad creators and the interpretations of viewers.

[Peter Pan Peanut Butter Commercial](https://youtu.be/GsBKYaeVJ2Y?si=BobZRZqcs7Fz6lWK). The commercial's ideological message suggests that consumption can bridge cultural differences, which is critiqued as a false narrative.

[1984 Apple commercial](https://youtu.be/VtvjbmoDx-I?si=lOTdbIMGbitRHZik) positions Apple as a liberating force against IBM's dominance, referencing Orwell's "1984" (Big Brother). In contrast, [IBM's commercial](https://youtu.be/mT-vb0yXC1o?si=mu2Aj9jwhUx14ZHQ) promotes productivity and harmony through technology, but critiques suggest it <u>misrepresents the reality of factory work.</u>

### 3.3. Ads and Art

The interpretation of art often involves questioning the <u>artist's intent and the societal context</u>, which can be challenging when the artist is unknown or the society has changed. Similar to art, advertisements are often interpreted without access to <u>the creators' intentions</u>, leading to varied personal meanings.

<u>It is dangerous to assume a literal representation from the eyes of the viewers.</u>
It is important to understand deeper meanings in both art and advertising, viewers should consider the context and cultural codes that shape interpretation.
