### 1.1. Social Media

[Social Media and Advertising](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/663709)
Social media advertising turns users into marketers, relationships into distribution channels, and emotions into measurable ROI.
* “两步流”理论（Two-step flow）：信息先传给“意见领袖”，再由他们影响普通人。
* 在社交媒体上，KOL（意见领袖）和网红就是现代的意见领袖。
* 品牌通过他们实现“去中心化”的传播，比传统广告更具说服力。


| 类型            | 举例                         | 广告用途              |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 社交网络站点（SNS）   | Facebook、Instagram、Twitter | 品牌建立形象、精准投放       |
| 用户生成内容平台（UGC） | YouTube、TikTok、Wikipedia   | 利用KOL/UGC内容进行软性植入 |
| 交易与营销平台（TMS）  | Amazon、eBay、Etsy           | 用户评价、推荐系统影响购买     |
| 游戏与娱乐平台（PGS）  | FarmVille、Second Life      | 游戏内广告、品牌植入        |

<p></p>

| 知识点                        | 说明                           | 广告业意义                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Weak Tie Theory（弱关系理论）** | 人们对“熟人”而非“密友”的传播更认真，因为需要维护形象 | 广告更容易通过“弱关系”传播（如朋友圈、微博转发） |
| **Earned Media 是广告业的金矿**   | 用户自发传播比品牌自己说更有说服力            | 品牌要设计**“值得被分享”**的内容，而不是“只卖产品” |
| **数字受众劳动是免费广告资源**          | 用户每一次互动都在为品牌工作               | 广告主要设计**“情感钩子”**让用户愿意传播       |
| **社交媒体广告=社交关系商品化**         | 广告平台把“人与人之间的关系”变成了可出售的资源     | 广告主不再只是买“广告位”，而是买**“人际关系链”**  |
| **品牌不再是信息的唯一控制者**          | 用户可以随时“反广告”（如恶搞、抵制、#标签运动）    | 广告主要更**谨慎、真实、透明**，否则会反噬       |

## 2. Am I being manipulated by advertising?

**Subliminal Advertising** : suggests that messages can be communicated below the level of conscious awareness, influencing consumer actions. [EXAMPLES](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/24/subliminal-advertising)
* <u>Why does the public want to believe in subliminal advertising?<u>
  * Displacement of Responsibility (to avoid accountability for their actions), Emotional Vulnerability, Complexity of Consumer Behavior, Cultural Narratives.
* 🤯 **Irrational Consumer Behavior**, allowing individuals to attribute their purchases to manipulation rather than personal choice.

<u>Public Perception of Advertising</u>: In US advertising practitioners are not trust by the public. While the perception of advertising varies globally.
Hollywood may conduce negative image on advertising business.

Ethics and Advertsing
* Deceptive Advertising : a product is claimed to have capabilities it does not possess (it could be ambiguous), leading to public manipulation.
* Misleading advertising often occurs when claims lack specific, verifiable details—leaving consumers unable to confirm the statement’s truth.
* Impression management.

## 3. What's in an ad beyond that which meets the eye?

### 3.1. Semiotics and Advertising

**Semiotics** (符号学) is the study of systems of signs (signifier + signified). then **Advertising** is the study of Semiotics system.
* <u>Ad for Milk (sign) = Superman (signifier) + Milk (signified)</u>. In the ad, the quality of superman (signifier) and milk (signified) are linked (this process is called semiotics).
* Ads use signifiers to transfer attributes to commodities.

<u>Building Brands Through Contrast</u>. Brands are built by carefully selecting signifiers that convey specific attributes and values, often in opposition to other brands.

</div>

* Ads are IDEOLOGICAL.
* Ads borrow referent systems (science, history, geography, evaluation, etc) from outside advertising and rework them.
* According to Williamson, the ideological power of ads can be dealt with by understanding how ads work.
  * And we need to understand them to avoid ads from <u>confusing us about the reality</u>.

### 3.2. The intentions of ad creators and the interpretations of viewers

The distinction between the intentions of ad creators and the interpretations of viewers.

[Peter Pan Peanut Butter Commercial](https://youtu.be/GsBKYaeVJ2Y?si=BobZRZqcs7Fz6lWK). The commercial's ideological message suggests that consumption can bridge cultural differences, which is critiqued as a false narrative.

[1984 Apple commercial](https://youtu.be/VtvjbmoDx-I?si=lOTdbIMGbitRHZik) positions Apple as a liberating force against IBM's dominance, referencing Orwell's "1984" (Big Brother). In contrast, [IBM's commercial](https://youtu.be/mT-vb0yXC1o?si=mu2Aj9jwhUx14ZHQ) promotes productivity and harmony through technology, but critiques suggest it <u>misrepresents the reality of factory work.</u>

### 3.3. Ads and Art

The interpretation of art often involves questioning the <u>artist's intent and the societal context</u>, which can be challenging when the artist is unknown or the society has changed. Similar to art, advertisements are often interpreted without access to <u>the creators' intentions</u>, leading to varied personal meanings.

<u>It is dangerous to assume a literal representation from the eyes of the viewers.</u>
It is important to understand deeper meanings in both art and advertising, viewers should consider the context and cultural codes that shape interpretation.

## 4. How do ads get made?

### 4.2. Creativity Case Study

**Old Spice**, a brand with a long history, aimed to modernize its image and attract a younger audience after being acquired by Procter & Gamble.

The [Old Spice commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGykVbfgUE) featured a humorous single-shot format, engaging both men and women, and was designed to highlight the brand's **masculine scent**.

* **Gender** is the socially defined differences between males and females, encompassing cultural ideas of masculinity and femininity.
* **Sexism** involves the unequal treatment of genders, similar to racism.

Issues in Advertising:
* Gender Representations - How is masculinity and femininity depicted?
* Sexist Representations - Are males and females treated unequally?
  * Advertising often depicts masculinity as powerful and dominant, while femininity is shown as passive and submissive.
* Using Sexual Imagery to Sell - How is sexuality linked to brand identities?
  * Used to attract attention and link products to brand identities.

## 6. Does sex sell?

Tom Reichert’s research (The Erotic History of Advertising):
* Sex in ads includes: undress, suggestive poses, double entendres, sexual language, implied nudity.
* Conclusion: Sex can increase attention and brand recall, but results are mixed and context-dependent.
* Some brands (e.g., Calvin Klein, Victoria’s Secret) successfully use erotic appeal.

## 7. What's the future of advertising?

**Historical Context of Advertising**
- Advertising has historically been ephemeral, with a short lifespan and little preservation of past materials.
- Significant collections of advertising history exist at institutions like Duke University and the Smithsonian, providing resources for studying advertising's evolution.

**Current Trends in Advertising**
- New advertising spaces are being utilized, such as unconventional locations like bathroom stalls and supermarket floors.
- Innovations include postage stamps featuring advertisements and advertisements on public transportation, showcasing the creative use of available spaces.

**Future Directions of Advertising**
- The potential for advertising to colonize new spaces, including the night sky and even human bodies, raises ethical questions.
- Emerging technologies, like Google Glass, may introduce new advertising formats, prompting discussions about the legitimacy of advertising in various contexts.

This lecture focuses on the evolving landscape of advertising and its future, highlighting innovative practices that are reshaping the industry.

Current Trends in Advertising
- **Total Marketing Communications**: The shift from traditional advertising methods to creating relationships with consumers, as seen in Apple's immersive store experience and Dove's campaign promoting real beauty.
