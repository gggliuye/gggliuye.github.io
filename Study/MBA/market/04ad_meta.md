## 2. Campaign Objective and Budget

Campaign Budget :

**Advertiser bids** represent the amount a business is willing to pay for a specific action, such as a website visit or app download.
* <u>The Highest Volume bid strategy</u> aims to maximize ad delivery and conversions without requiring a specific bid amount.
* <u>The Cost per Result Goal strategy</u> allows advertisers to set an *average* cost they are willing to pay for a desired outcome, focusing on cost efficiency.
* <u>The Bid Cap strategy</u> limits the *maximum* amount Meta can bid in each auction, ensuring that advertisers do not exceed their budget for individual actions.
