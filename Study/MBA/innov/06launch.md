# 1. Earning Revenue

<u>The difference between a startup concept and a startup business is paying customers.</u>

## 1.1 Go-To-Market Strategy
<p></p>

* [Leslie’s Compass: A Framework For Go-To-Market Strategy](https://review.firstround.com/leslies-compass-a-framework-for-go-to-market-strategy/) marketing and sales are counterbalances: <u>If you’re marketing-intensive, the product is bought. If it’s sales-intensive, the product is sold.</u>
  * Use 7 factors : <u>Price, Market Size, Complexity, Fit, Customer, Relationship, Touch, </u> to determine <u>whether you have a sales-intensive or marketing-intensive product</u>.

 Go-to-market strategy describes how you'll use direct or indirect <u>marketing, sales, and distribution channels</u> to deliver your solution to your target customers. The ultimate goal is to **generate sales** as efficiently, effectively, and profitably as possible.
Elements of go-to-market strategy:

* Target Customers : B2B vs. b2c; Buyers vs. end user; Job title or position; Influencers.
* Building Awareness : website (or landing page); Personal networks; Referrals.
* <u>Outbound Marketing</u> (boardcasting message to potential customers) : advertising; public relations; direct mail, email, phone calls; in-person sales calls.
* <u>Inbound Marketing</u> (passive, help customers who are actively seeking a solution to find you) (less expensive, and more effective): word of month; SEO; Content creation; Social media; Events.
  * Credibility & become an trusty Authority.
* Online / Physical <u>Sales Channels</u>.
  * Selection : depends on the <u>customer relationship</u> desired; customers expectation; channel capabilities.
* <u>Metrics</u>:
  * Revenue per dollar of sales expense.
  * Closing/conversion rate.
  * Length of sales cycle.
  * Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).
  * Vanity metrics.

## 3.1 Equity - Angels & Venture Capitalists
<p></p>

- **Self-Financing**: Entrepreneurs often start by using their own savings, which signals commitment to potential investors.
- **Family and Friends**: These individuals can provide initial support based on personal connections rather than financial returns.

🍎 **Angel Investors**: Wealthy individuals who invest their own money, often bringing expertise and connections to the business. They typically invest in a portfolio of startups and expect high returns.
* [The american angel](https://www.lunarmobiscuit.com/the-american-angel/) have high risk tolerance and expect high return.
* Take a <u>portfolio approach</u>, since <u>10% of investments produced 85%-90% of returns.</u>
* Find them through <u>organized groups and networks</u> : university-related, geographic regions, syndication platforms.

🍎 **Venture Capitalists**(风险投资者):  Professionally managed partnerships, investing institutional capital. Managers receive a management fess and a "carried interest" in the eventual profits.
* A wide range of investment strategies depends on different managers.
* Very high return targets - IRR targets > 40%. (expect one or two big successes to pay for many more failures)
* To Approach VCs:  
  * Use a referral from a successful entrepreneur or respected advisor.
  * Do Your Homework: Research the VC's investment strategies and portfolio companies.
  * Presentation and executive summary.
  * Build a relationship before asking for money - seek advice first.
  * Don't lead with an NDA. Don't propose your own terms nor valuation. Don't wait until you're out of money.

## 3.2 Venture Capital Valuation

**Valuation Process**: Entrepreneurs and investors negotiate the business's worth, considering factors like the business plan, management team, and competitive advantage.
- **Investor's Required Return (R)**: This is calculated based on the investment amount (I), the investor's rate of return (r), and the time until the investment is realized (T).
  * $R=I (1+r)^{T}$
- **Future Value (V)**: Estimated using projected revenue or profit (P) and valuation multiples (M) from comparable companies.
  * $V = PM$
- **Ownership Percentage (X)**: Calculated as the required return divided by the future value, determining how much of the company the investor will own.
  * $X = R/V$
- **Post-Money and Pre-Money Valuation**: The post-money value includes the investment, while the pre-money value reflects the business's worth before the investment.
  * Post-money = I/X.
  * Pre-money = Post-money - I. (on the entrepreneur's side of the table)

**Staged Financing** : (1) seed capital; (2) first round; (3) second round; (4) mezzanine.
* Investors: Reduce risk. Flexibility. Investor Confidence.
* Entrepreneurs: Increased Valuation. Maintain more ownershup.
* The company must achieve milestones to justify lower rates of return and higher valuations in the future rounds.

## 3.3 Deal Terms and Negotiations

**Types of Securities**: Everything from common stock to bonds is considered a security. For venture capital, companies typically need to be structured as **C Corporations** for tax reasons.

**Investment Structure**: Venture capitalists prefer **Convertible Preferred Stock**, which offers downside protection and can be converted to common shares if the company succeeds.

- **Key Terms**:
  - **Liquidation Preference**: Preferred shares are paid out before common shares in case of liquidation.
  - **Anti-Dilution Rights**: Protect investors if the company's share price decreases in future financing rounds.
  - **Founder Vesting**: Founders must stay with the company for a set period to earn their shares, aligning interests with investors.

**Negotiation Tips**: Entrepreneurs should aim for a fair deal, focusing on major issues like valuation and board structure, and consider having an experienced attorney during negotiations.

**Convertible Securities**: Startups often use convertible debt or SAFEs (Simple Agreements for Future Equity) to raise initial capital without immediate valuation discussions.

# 4. Managing Growth

## 4.1 Growth Metrics

Readings :
* Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
  * [How Much Did That New Customer Cost You? 2013](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-much-did-that-new-customer-cost-you/225415) 准确计算<u>客户获取成本</u>是评估营销活动有效性的关键。
  * [Customer Acquisition and Startups 2019](https://medium.com/swlh/customer-acquisition-cost-and-startups-82286dba95b1)
* [How to Calculate the Lifetime Value of a Customer 2012](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-calculate-the-lifetime-value-of-a-customer/224153): （平均每次销售价值）×（重复购买次数）×（典型客户平均留存时间）。以确定获客成本，制定营销策略。


**Importance of Metrics**: Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) is essential to manage growth and ensure the business is on track. <u>To face environment changes, and to help make key decisions</u> - **Shifting Priorities**.

- **Strategic Planning**: Continuous evaluation of market conditions, customer needs, and business strategies is necessary as the company evolves.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Developing specific, testable hypotheses about business strategies helps in assessing their effectiveness.

**Key Metrics**: Important metrics include customer acquisition cost (CAC), customer lifetime value (CLTV), sales conversion rate, and churn rate. These metrics help in understanding the business's health and scalability.

**Avoiding Vanity Metrics**: Focus on metrics that truly impact business objectives rather than superficial statistics that do not correlate with success.

## 4.2 Pivots
<p></p>

* Youtube : [Eric Ries explains The Pivot 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC_IG-EZQUY)
* [You can pivot, but you should never twirl 2014](https://www.inc.com/howard-tullman/you-can-pivot-but-you-should-never-twirl.html) 指出过度转型的危害，并批判了精益创业理念中的一些误导（It’s actually not all right to have your first customers be your last beta testers），强调应将客户需求置于首位。应该找到**最小可行受众(Minimum Viable Audience MVA)**，之后再运用 MVP 方法，为目标客户迭代优化产品或服务。

**Build, Measure, Learn Cycle**: This feedback loop encourages continuous improvement by testing assumptions about customers and the market, learning from results, and adjusting strategies accordingly. 🧠[Lean Startup](/Study/MBA/company/03leanstartup).

A **pivot** is a significant change in strategy when initial business model assumptions are proven incorrect. It is essential for startups to adapt when their original approach isn't working. **Types of Pivots**:
- **Zoom-in Pivot**: Focusing on a single feature that becomes the main product (e.g., Flickr).
- **Zoom-out Pivot**: The entire product becomes a feature of a larger offering.
- **Customer Segment Pivot**: Targeting a different customer group.
- **Customer Need Pivot**: Changing the strategy to meet a different need of the same customer group.
- **Value Capture Pivot**: Adjusting pricing or revenue models.
- **Engine of Growth Pivot**: Changing customer acquisition strategies.
- **Channel Pivot**: Altering how the product reaches customers.
- **Technology Pivot**: Delivering the same value proposition through a new method.

After pivoting, it's crucial to continue testing new assumptions to ensure they are valid.
Entrepreneurs should consider how many pivots they can afford before running out of resources.

## 4.3 Failing Well
<p></p>

* [483 startup failure post-mortems 2021](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-post-mortem/)
* Quora : [When is it the right time to look for a soft landing or acquihire?](https://www.quora.com/When-is-it-the-right-time-to-look-for-a-soft-landing-or-acquihire)
* [How to Shut Down Your Struggling Startup 2013](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-shut-down-your-struggling-startup/231036)

Failure can be devastating but is often a part of the entrepreneurial journey. Learning from failure can lead to future success.
- **Honesty and Transparency**: Being honest with yourself and stakeholders (investors, employees, etc.) about the situation is crucial. This builds trust and respect.
- **Cash Management**: Managing cash flow is essential, especially when facing insolvency. Prioritize obligations to creditors and employees.
- **Soft Landing Strategies**: Planning for a "soft landing" can help minimize negative impacts. This may involve selling assets or an "aquihire" to retain talent.
- **Learning from Mistakes**: Analyze what went wrong to improve future ventures. Understanding market assumptions and team dynamics is vital.
